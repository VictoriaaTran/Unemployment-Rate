Data Analysis:
    <li> Decision Tree </li>
    <li> Random Forest </li> 
    <li> Clustering </li>
Data Visualization: visualize the comparison between Unemployment rate in CA versus other states, visualize Decision Tree to determine the important feature. 
Optimization: using Random Forest to boost accuracy from Decision Tree classification.
Clustering: using Clustering method to group counties with similar attributes and economic characteristics.
