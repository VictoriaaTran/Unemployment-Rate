<h1> Overview </h1>
This project aims to discover Unemployment rate in various counties in California.

<h2> Methods </h2>

1. Data Preprocessing: convert to correct data type, drop rows with null values, selecting the appropriate states to observe, describe and manipulate data.
 <br>

2. Data Analysis:
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest 
    - Clustering 

3. Data Visualization: visualize the comparison between Unemployment rate in CA versus other states, visualize Decision Tree to determine the important feature. <br>

4. Optimization: using Random Forest to boost accuracy from Decision Tree classification. <br>

5. Clustering: using Clustering method to group counties with similar attributes and economic characteristics.
